            Microsoft Innovation Center ASBL (hereafter « MIC », « the
            company », « us », « we ») knows that you care how information about you is
            used and shared, and we appreciate you trusting that we will do so carefully
            and sensibly. To better protect your privacy, we provide this Privacy Policy
            explaining our practices and the choices you can make about the way your
            information is collected and used by Ada. The information below explains our
            policy regarding your privacy, both online and offline. By visiting our website
            www.mic-belgique.be or sharing personal information with Ada via any of its

        <p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>
            When use our applications, or interact with our chatbot with
            the purpose of getting information about us, you may provide us with personal
            information (such as name, address, email address, telephone numbers and/or
            credit/debit card information) that you knowingly choose to disclose, which is
            collected on an individual basis for various purposes. These purposes include
            registering to receive email newsletters or other materials, requesting further
            information from us about projects and services, making requests, submitting a
            form on our website, or simply asking a question. We receive and store any
            information you enter on our website or give us in any other way. We ask for
            personal information so that we can fulfill your request and return your
            message. This information is retained and used in accordance with existing laws,
            rules, regulations, and other policies in force in the European Union.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>
            Ada does not collect personal information from you unless
            you provide it to us. If you choose not to provide any of that information, we
            may not be able to fulfill your request, but you will still be free to browse
            the other sections of the websites owned and administered by us. This means
            that you can visit our site without telling us who you are or revealing any
            personally identifiable information about yourself.&nbsp;
        </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><b><u>The way we use information&nbsp;</u></b></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>
            When you supply information about yourself for a specific
            purpose, we use the information for only that purpose (such as to provide the
            service or information you have requested). For example, you may be asked to
            give us individual information to receive information, through your personal
            network. We do not share this information with outside parties except to the
            extent necessary to complete your request. Similarly, should you decide to
            share any of your friends’ data (names), it would only be used in the context
            of the intended request or experience within our site, chatbot or application.
            You can register with our website if you would like to receive updates on our
            new projects and services. Information you submit on our website, over the phone,
            or via our chatbot will not be used for this purpose unless a subscription is
            created via a form or in accordance with the platform’s policy. We use return
            email addresses to answer the email we receive. Such addresses are not used for
            any other purpose and are not shared with outside parties. MIC does not sell,
            rent, give-away or share its email addresses or other personal contact
            information with outside sources. MIC also does not send mailings on behalf of
            other organizations.
        </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>
            Should any material changes be made to the ways in which we
            use personally identifiable information, MIC will take commercially reasonable
            measures to obtain consent from you. We will also post the changes to our use
            of personally identifiable information on our website, applications or chatbots
            at least 30 days prior to a change.
        </p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><b><u>Our commitment to data security&nbsp;</u></b></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal><o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></p>

        <p class=MsoNormal>
            Personally identifiable information is stored on our server
            and is not publicly accessible. Further, personally identifiable information is
            only accessed by MIC’s staff on a &quot;need to know&quot; basis. To prevent
            unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of
            information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and
            managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect
            online. Additionally, sensitive data such as debit card numbers are encrypted
            using SSL and other industry standard measures, to provide an additional level
            of security.
